# Virtual Try-On Avatar Prototype

## Overview
This project is a prototype developed for the prefinale of the Myntra HackerRamp "We for She" hackathon. It aims to create an avatar from the user's body measurements, acting as a mannequin for virtual try-ons. This solution is designed to reduce return rates and increase user engagement on online shopping platforms.

## Key Features
- **Avatar Creation**: Generates a virtual mannequin based on the user's body measurements.
- **Privacy-Friendly**: Eliminates the need for users to share pictures, addressing privacy concerns.
- **Virtual Try-On**: Allows users to see how clothes fit on their avatar.

## Future Enhancements
- **Gender Selection**: Enable users to choose the mannequin's gender to better match different body types.
- **AI Recommendations**: Provide personalized fit suggestions, such as "the dress would be tight around the waist," "the dress would look good on you," or "Maybe try M size."

## How to Use
1. **Input Measurements**: Enter your body measurements to generate your avatar.
2. **Select Clothing**: Choose the clothing item you want to try on.
3. **View Fit**: See how the clothing fits on your avatar.

## Limitations
- This is a demo prototype with limited functionality.
- Future improvements are planned to enhance the user experience.
